# Elixir2pdf

Elixir2pdf is a simple Elixir wrapper for ErlGuten, a Erlang PDF generation application. It is limited to my current needs of ErlGuten's functionality as well as some additional functionality not provided by ErlGuten, but I will continue to explore ErlGuten and improve Elixir2pdf over time. If you require specific functionality of ErlGuten that is not currently provided, please submit an [issue](https://github.com/kennellroxco/elixir2pdf/issues). 

## Installation

The package can be installed via GitHub:

    def deps do
      [{:elixir2pdf, github: "kennellroxco/elixir2pdf"}]
    end

## Basic Usage

## Contributing 

Contributions are encouraged. Feel free to fork the repo, add your code along with appropriate tests and documentation (ensuring all existing tests continue to pass) and submit a pull request.
